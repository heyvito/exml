# exml

üßë‚Äçüíª Go XML generator without Structs‚Ñ¢

Package `exml` allows XML documents to be generated without the usage of structs or maps. It is not intended for
every-day usage, since package `xml` will probably be a better option.

## Installing

You probably already know the drill:

```
go get github.com/heyvito/exml
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	
	"github.com/heyvito/exml"
)

func main() {
    doc := exml.Document{
        ProcessingInstruction: exml.XML10ProcessingInstruction,
    }

    ns := doc.AddNamespace("foo", "https://tempuri.org")
    root := exml.MakeNode("root", exml.WithNamespace(ns), exml.WithAttribute("attr", "value"))
    root.AppendChild("child", exml.WithInnerText("Some value here"))
    child := root.AppendChild("other-child", exml.WithAttribute("len", "1"))
    child.AppendChild("other-tag", exml.WithInnerText("More text\nWith line breaks."))

    fmt.Println(doc.String())
}
```

The code above will print the following XML document:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root xmlns:foo="https://tempuri.org">
    <child>Some value here</child>
    <other-child len="1">
        <other-tag>
            More text
            With line breaks.
        </other-tag>
    </other-child>
</root>
```
